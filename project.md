Challenge 1: Use Terraform to create a Kubernetes cluster, configure Jenkins and Ansible to deploy a Dockerized application to the cluster, and use Git to manage code changes.

Challenge 2: Use Ansible to provision Docker containers on multiple hosts, use Git to manage the codebase, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 3: Use Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, use Ansible to configure Docker hosts and deploy a containerized application, and use Git to manage the codebase.

Challenge 4: Use Kubernetes to manage a multi-node cluster, use Ansible to configure and deploy a complex application, use Git to manage code changes, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 5: Use Docker to build and run a containerized application, use Ansible to automate container orchestration and management, use Git to manage the codebase, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 6: Use Kubernetes to deploy and manage a microservices-based application, use Ansible to manage and orchestrate the deployment across multiple nodes, use Git to manage code changes, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 7: Use Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, use Ansible to configure and deploy a Dockerized application, use Git to manage the codebase, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 8: Use Docker to build and run a containerized application, use Ansible to manage and orchestrate container deployment across multiple nodes, use Git to manage the codebase, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 9: Use Kubernetes to deploy and manage a highly available, scalable web application, use Ansible to manage and orchestrate the deployment across multiple nodes, use Git to manage code changes, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments.

Challenge 10: Use Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure on multiple cloud providers, use Ansible to configure and deploy containerized applications, use Git to manage code changes, and use Jenkins to automate builds and deployments across all environments.
